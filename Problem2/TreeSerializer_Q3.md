To extend support for various data types within the tree, as opposed to being 
limited to integers, we can introduce Java generics to specify the data type of the node, 
enabling greater adaptability.

It's important to note that not all data types can be directly supported 
unless a defined mechanism for their serialization and deserialization exists. 
While Java's fundamental built-in types can be handled relatively straightforwardly, 
user-defined types or intricate data structures may require custom serialization methods 
or the integration of a serialization library.

Proceeding Step by Step:

1. Modify the Node Class to support genetics:

```java
public class Node<T> {
    Node<T> left;
    Node<T> right;
    T data;
}
```

2. Modify the Serializer Interface to support generics as well:

```java
public interface TreeSerializer<T> {
    String serialize(Node<T> root);
    Node<T> deserialize(String str);
}
```

When serializing data of type T in the Node, basic Java types (such as String, Integer, Double, etc.) can be converted to a string using `String.valueOf(data)`. User-defined types
will need to have a way to stringify them.

During deserialization, there needs to be a method for determining the type and converting the string back to its original form.

For both processes (especially for deserialization), I would use the Strategy pattern to use the appropriate data conversion mechanism based on the type of data.
